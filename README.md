## Assessment Artifact for Imersive Technologies
  
Augmented Reality Web App that uses OpenStreetMap and retrieves nearby locations from GeoJson-based web API. All locations are shown as 3D models with a notice board with basic information; different types of places, such as cafes/restaurants each have a unique model. Clicking a model will redirect to the respective website if available. A Heads-up display shows your current latitude and longitude at all times but the device and locations altitude is also taken into consideration when placing the models. Keyboard support was added to help test the application.
